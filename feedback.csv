1,2025-01-15,Love the app! Transfers are instant and the UI is clean.
2,2025-01-18,Can't log in after the last update—says 'session expired' every time.
3,2025-01-20,Please add biometric login. Typing my password on the bus is annoying.
4,2025-01-22,Fees are too high for international transfers. Competitors are cheaper.
5,2025-01-24,Best banking app I've used. Notifications are on point.
6,2025-01-26,Login keeps failing. Support said clear cache but it didn't help.
7,2025-01-28,Would be great to have spending categories and monthly budgets.
8,2025-01-30,"App crashes when I open statements. Using it for 6 months, started last week."
9,2025-02-01,Quick balance check and pay bills in seconds. No complaints.
10,2025-02-03,Why do I pay €5/month for this when basic features are missing?
11,2025-02-05,Face ID works 50% of the time. Often falls back to password.
12,2025-02-07,Card controls (freeze/unfreeze) are super useful. More of this please.
13,2025-02-09,Logged me out randomly and had to reset password. Very frustrating.
14,2025-02-11,Add dark mode. Using it at night is harsh on the eyes.
15,2025-02-13,Interest rates on savings are a joke compared to others.
16,2025-02-15,Smooth experience overall. Only wish there was a desktop version.
17,2025-02-17,Login with fingerprint fails after phone restart. Known bug?
18,2025-02-19,"Request: let me nickname my accounts (e.g. 'Rent', 'Fun money')."
19,2025-02-21,App is fine but subscription price went up with no new features.
20,2025-02-23,Support was fast and fixed my login issue. Happy customer.
21,2025-02-25,Need export to CSV for my accounts. For taxes and budgeting.
22,2025-02-27,Sometimes stuck on loading after login. Have to force close.
23,2025-03-01,Bill splitting with friends would be a game changer.
24,2025-03-03,"Free for basic use, premium is overpriced for what you get."
25,2025-03-05,Clean design and no ads. Refreshing for a banking app.
26,2025-03-07,Two-factor is a pain—codes often arrive late or not at all.
27,2025-03-09,Would love recurring transfers and standing orders from the app.
28,2025-03-11,Crashed during a transfer. Money left my account but recipient didn't get it. Took 3 days to resolve.
29,2025-03-13,Best part is instant notifications. I always know when money moves.
30,2025-03-15,Login page sometimes doesn't load. Only works after 2–3 tries.
31,2025-03-17,Add joint accounts and shared goals. Me and my partner would use it.
32,2025-03-19,Monthly fee for 'premium' when other banks offer same for free. Rethink pricing.
33,2025-03-21,Simple and reliable. Been using it for a year with no major issues.
34,2025-03-23,Password reset link expires too quickly. Had to request it twice.
35,2025-03-25,Request: round-up purchases to nearest euro and save the difference.
36,2025-03-27,App is good but too many upsells for insurance and loans.
37,2025-03-29,Login with Apple/Google would be great. One less password to remember.
38,2025-03-31,"No issues so far. Fast, clear, does what I need."
39,2025-04-02,"After update, login loop: enter PIN, then it asks again. Unusable."
40,2025-04-04,Please add widget for home screen with balance (with hide option).
41,2025-04-06,Fee for receiving international payments is unfair. Sender already paid.
42,2025-04-08,Card ordering and activation from the app is seamless. Big plus.
43,2025-04-10,Biometric works on iOS but not on my Android. Inconsistent.
44,2025-04-12,Would like scheduled payments—e.g. pay rent on the 1st automatically.
45,2025-04-14,Pricing is transparent. No hidden fees. App could be prettier but it works.
46,2025-04-16,Session timeout is too short. Logged out while reading my statement.
47,2025-04-18,Request: virtual cards for online shopping with custom limits.
48,2025-04-20,Premium tier doesn't justify the cost. Basic is enough for me.
49,2025-04-22,Reliable and fast. Only minor gripe is no in-app chat support.
50,2025-04-24,Login issues after changing phone. Account recovery took a week. Needs improvement.
